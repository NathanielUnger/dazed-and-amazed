## statement of problem
  Navigate a two-dimensional maze and
  
  return a boolean value determining whether or not it is navigable.

## recursive abstraction
  When I am asked to
    <br>     return the boolean value of the statement "the maze is navigable, having a legal travel path that is continuous from start point to existing treasure"
    <br>the recursive abstraction can
  <br>     return the boolean value of the statement "the maze is navigable, having a legal travel path that is continuous from start point to existing treasure" given moves already made.
