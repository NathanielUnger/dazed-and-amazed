/**

  Represent a maze, containing an existing treasure for use with the maze
  solver problem.

  A space " " respresents a wall, a "x" represents a stepping stone, where
  the explorer is legally allowed to move onto, an "e" is the explorer, and
  a "0" is the desired treasure.

  MazeSolver.java will find a path between the explorer and the treasure,
  given that there is a *legal* travelling path and that there is an
  existing treasure.
